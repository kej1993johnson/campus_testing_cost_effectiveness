# campus_testing_cost_effectiveness

# This repo contains all scripts and data needed to generate the figures in the manuscript, for the use case of the University of Texas at Austin in the Fall of 2021

# testing_cost_effectiveness_fxns.R contains all functions needed to run the transmission model and generate the health and economic outputs 

# assign_other_inputs.Rmd is where the parameters are assigned and writes to cost_table.csv, par_bounds.csv, and par_table.csv

# testing_main_figures.Rmd reassigns the parameters and bounds and writes to cost_table.csv, par_bounds.csv, and par_table.csv, then it uses these to generate all the figures in the main text and supplement of the manuscript. These are all specific to UT in the fall of 2021.
